# Big Data Project (Spring 2020)
This project was the work of Camille Taltas and Annika Brundyn. The goal was to explore the challenges that come with handling very large datasets by building a book recommender system using Goodreads data. The report can be found in DSGA1004_FinalProject.pdf. The prepare_data.py cleans the data and forms the appropriate train, validation, and test sets. The train.py and test.py are the codes which cover the modeling part of the project. Lastly, the extension.py script is for the single-machine implementation of the collaberative filtering model. This projects uses Hadoop and Spark to handle the data more efficiently and safely.
